**Do you have many close friends?**

No, I don't have many close friends. I prefer to keep my circle small and focus on building deeper, more meaningful relationships with a few people rather than having a large number of acquaintances. I find that having a few close friends allows me to give and receive more support, trust, and understanding

**Which do you prefer to spend time with: a friend or spend time alone?**

I prefer to spend time alone. Being alone allows me to relax, and do activities I enjoy without any distractions. It helps me recharge. While spending time with friends is fun, I value the peace and quiet that comes with being by myself.

**What kind of people do you like to have as friend?**
I don't have any specifics but I think with people I feel compatible and happy

**Do you like face-to-face conversations with people?**
No, I don't like face-to-face conversations with people. I prefer communicating through messages or online. It gives me more time to think and respond without feeling pressured. While face-to-face talks can be engaging, I feel more at ease when I have some space.

**What do you and your friends do together?**
We often play games together. Because we live far away, whenever we get together, we will organize a meal.

**Do you think it is possible to become real friends with people you meet on the internet?**

Yes, I think it's possible to become real friends with people you meet on the internet. Online interactions can lead to meaningful connections if you take the time to get to know each other and share common interests. Many friendships start online and grow into strong, real-life relationships. However, it's important to be cautious and ensure that the person is genuine before meeting in person.

**Do you think carefully about what you eat?**
No, I don’t always think carefully about what I eat. I often find myself choosing convenience over health, especially when I'm busy. I sometimes eat fast food or snacks without considering their nutritional value. Although I know it's important to eat well, I don't always take the time to plan my meals or choose healthier options.

**Do you eat much fast food?**
Yes, I do eat quite a bit of fast food. It's convenient and quick, especially when I'm busy or don't feel like cooking. I enjoy the taste, and it's easy to grab something on the go. However, I know it's not the healthiest option, so I try to balance it with healthier meals when I can.

**In what ways do you try to stay healthy?**
**I try to stay healthy in several ways.** First, I make an effort to eat a balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. I also **drink** plenty of **water** and limit sugary drinks. Second, **I exercise regularly,** whether it's going for a run, doing some strength training, or just taking a walk. Additionally, **I try to get enough sleep each night** and manage stress through activities like meditation or spending time with friends and family. Overall, I believe that a combination of good nutrition, physical activity, and mental well-being is key to staying healthy.

**Is it important to you to eat healthy food?**
Yes, it's important to me to eat healthy food. I believe that what we eat has a big impact on our overall health and well-being. Eating nutritious foods helps me feel more energetic, stay focused, and maintain a healthy weight. It also supports my immune system and **reduces the risk** of developing chronic illnesses. While I do enjoy treats now and then, I try to make healthy choices most of the time because I know it's essential for my long-term health.

=> I believe that what we eat has a big impact on our overall health. Eat healthy food help us has muc energy, stay focus, and strong. Special, reduce the risk of diseases such as high blood pressure

**What could you do to have a healthier lifestyle?**
To have a healthier lifestyle, I could make a few changes. First, I could be more consistent with my exercise routine, making sure I stay active every day, even if it's just a short walk or some stretching. Second, I could focus more on meal planning and preparing healthy meals in advance, which would help me avoid the temptation of fast food. I could also work on getting more sleep by setting a regular bedtime and reducing screen time before bed. Lastly, I could manage stress better by practicing mindfulness or engaging in relaxing activities like reading or spending time outdoors. These small changes could make a big difference in my overall health.

=>I think, I will go to bed early and get enough sleep to help me not be tired for the next day. Regular exercise helps me to be healthy and reduce the risk of disease and finally, eating enough nutrients to have a healthy body.

**What do you think is more important, eating healthy or doing exercise?**
I think both eating healthy and doing exercise are important, but if I had to choose, I might say that eating healthy is slightly more important. The reason is that what we eat directly affects our body’s ability to function properly, including how much energy we have, how well our immune system works, and even our mood. No matter how much we exercise, if we're not fueling our bodies with the right nutrients, it can be difficult to see the full benefits of physical activity. That being said, exercise is also crucial for maintaining overall health, so ideally, it’s best to focus on both.

=>  we eat directly affects our body’s ability to function properly và providing **vital nutrients** is a way to **build a strong immune system** help reduce the risk of disease

When I am late for an appointment, I usually feel worried because I don't like making others wait, so I feel a embarrassed. I try to apologize as soon as I arrive and explain why I was late.
