# Tip for beginer
- avoid tutorial hell:
	- the best way to learn is by doing.
	- code along with the instructor => try build project from scratch without tutorial => repeat this process until can build project without tutorial
- consistent study habits: study 30 minutes everyday better than to 10 hours once a week
- clear goal
- build project
